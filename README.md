# Final project

This is a book teaser Single Page Application about a book.
It's about a group of women who during the nineteenhundreds saved their whole village from starving by walking all across northern Europe to sell and make jwellery out of human hair.

## The problem

The site is build with a frontend using React and gets it's content through Contentful CMS, that uses GraphQL to fetch the data.
The backend uses a express server and mongo db with a RESTFUL endpoint that is used for storing the users email.
